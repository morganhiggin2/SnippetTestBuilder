1. When switching projects and on parameters window, it shows blank until refresh again
2. text area does not expand with screen or text
3. cargo test is not compiling. Decouple all tauri things code and package as seperate library
    - tauri app handle has to be deocupled
    - can define a trait in the library that the tauri app can define the logic using the app handle, to avoid having to use tauri code in rust code
